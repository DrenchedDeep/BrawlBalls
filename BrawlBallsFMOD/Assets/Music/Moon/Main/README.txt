Unfortunately, music is a bitch and my mind is completely fried from listening to the same audio tracks for 3 days straight, so this is what's happening.

Everything follows the same naming culture as RoofTopWreckers, so if there's any issue with naming refer to the structure of that map's music and how things are named. However, There is a section that i genuinely dont know where it'd be better. 

I've separated it in the mix with the name 'MSC_MoonCraterHATS', and as the name suggests it's a bunch of high-hats that fit with the music. I don't know where it'd be better suited, so you can either mix it into 'MSC_MoonCraterAction' or 'MSC_MoonCraterMain' exclusively (so not mixed with the alternate version of MoonCraterMain, 'MSC_MoonCraterTypeA')

Along with this, 'MSC_MoonCraterEXTRAS' is a bunch of claps that also fit anywhere, but probably shouldn't be added to either Main or TypeA because itll sound really outa place. 

go wild, or don't add it, or do whatever. i don't care.
